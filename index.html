        <p>Cambodia’s real-estate market is showing renewed momentum in 2024–2025. Strong GDP/tourism recovery, large infrastructure programmes and renewed investor interest (especially in condos, housing and logistics) are the main growth engines — but the market has clear risks (regulatory/oversupply/funding). The opportunity is real for investors who use local partners, structure deals correctly (strata titles, leases, JVs) and target the right sectors.</p>

        <h1>Industrial</h1>
        <p>Industrial trading is the buying and selling of goods and materials specifically for industrial use — raw materials, components, machinery, spare parts, chemicals, packaging, and inputs used in manufacturing or large-scale services. It sits between producers (manufacturers, mines, farms) and industrial consumers (factories, construction companies, large retailers). Transactions can be B2B, often in bulk, and commonly use contracts, definitive shipments, and trade finance.</p>

        <h1>ENERGY</h1>
        <p>As of December 2024, the average residential electricity tariff in Cambodia was about KHR 610 per kWh, equivalent to approximately USD 0.152 per kWh—this includes generation, distribution, transmission, taxes, and fees GlobalPetrolPrices.com.
            On a global scale, this rate is about 95.6 % of the world average, and notably higher than the Asian average, at around 187.8 % GlobalPetrolPrices.com.
            Anecdotal user reports in Phnom Penh mention paying as much as USD 0.26/kWh in older-style housing or shared setups Reddit, though these seem above the national average.</p>

        <h1>Agriculture</h1>
        <p>Cambodia’s agri-sector is still a large part of the economy and has seen strong export momentum (rice and other agro-exports grew sharply into 2024–2025). At the same time the country is receiving public and MDB finance for climate-resilient irrigation and there are clear gaps in cold chain, processing and logistics — making value-addition and resilience projects especially attractive.</p>

        <h1>MEDIA</h1>
        <p>Cambodia’s digital market is young and rapidly growing. As of 2025, 72.4% of Cambodians are active on social media, and e-commerce sales are projected to reach $1.78 billion. Urban populations use Facebook, TikTok and Telegram heavily, and businesses are increasingly shifting marketing budgets online. Tech startups in Cambodia have boomed – from 50 in 2013 to ~300 by 2018 – many in media, advertising and e-commerce. This creates strong demand for local content and marketing services. The One Media will target Cambodian Millennials and Gen Z (as well as Khmer-speaking diaspora) with mobile-optimized, Khmer-language content and social commerce, while using global platforms (YouTube, Instagram, etc.) to gain traffic.</p>
